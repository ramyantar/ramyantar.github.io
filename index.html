        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Ramy Alham, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering (Design and Manufacturing) from Assiut University in Egypt, where I ranked first out of 135 students and received an Excellent with honor grade. After completing my degree, I worked as a Teaching and Research Assistant at Assiut University for over a year and a half, where I taught various mechanical design courses and conducted research in rehabilitation robotics.</p>

        <p>I am a Certified SOLIDWORKS Expert in Mechanical Design and a Certified SOLIDWORKS Professional in Sheet Metal, Weldments, Surfacing, and Drawing Tools. As a mechanical design engineer, I have three years of experience designing and manufacturing machines and robotics. Through my work, I have gained extensive experience in designing and building robotic systems and have discovered a passion for learning about other robotics topics.</p>

        <p>As a marine robotics master's student, I gained a strong understanding of the principles of robotics, including modeling, control, ROS, autonomous systems, machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and marine science. I believe an internship with you would be a valuable opportunity for me to gain more knowledge. My interests currently are Robotic manipulation, Localization and Mapping, and Autonomous Systems. I hope to continue on to a Ph.D. related to these areas.</p>
